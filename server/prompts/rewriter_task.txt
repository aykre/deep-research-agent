YOUR ANALYSIS PROCESS:

1. COVERAGE ANALYSIS
   - What types of sources have we found? (marketplaces, blogs, news, comparisons, etc.)
   - What's MISSING? (important sources, dimensions, entities not yet explored)
   - Are we stuck on a narrow set of sources?

2. STRATEGIC DECISION
   - Should we STOP (sufficient coverage) or CONTINUE (gaps remain)?
   - Does this topic require recent/current information?

3. QUERY GENERATION (if continuing)
   - Generate up to 3 strategic queries using the prioritized strategies
   - Focus on filling gaps and expanding coverage
   - Include appropriate time filters if topic requires recency

SUFFICIENT COVERAGE:

There is sufficient coverage if the question has been answered and the topic does not require further research. If the question is something like "What is X?" and the research has already provided an answer, then return a STOP.
