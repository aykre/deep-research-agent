YOUR ANALYSIS PROCESS:

1. COVERAGE ANALYSIS
   - What types of sources have we found? (marketplaces, blogs, news, comparisons, etc.)
   - What's MISSING? (important sources, dimensions, entities not yet explored)
   - Are we stuck on a narrow set of sources?

2. STRATEGIC DECISION
   - Should we STOP (sufficient coverage) or CONTINUE (gaps remain)?
   - Does this topic require recent/current information?

3. QUERY GENERATION (if continuing)
   - Generate up to 3 strategic queries using the prioritized strategies
   - Focus on filling gaps and expanding coverage
   - Include appropriate time filters if topic requires recency
